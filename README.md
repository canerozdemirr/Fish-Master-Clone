# Fish-Master-Clone
The clone of the original hypercasual Fish Master game that was published by Voodoo.

I used Unity 2019.3.7f1 version of Unity. Due to the prefab changes and other critical updates that Unity received, you should not try to open this file with a lower version. Upper versions are mostly fine, but lower versions will require significant steps to open this project.

I used DOTween to animate the fishes and hook, so you might want to look at a DOTween documentation before you download the project if you never worked with DOTween before.

Feel free to ask any questions you have, I will upgrade this project with few minor changes like adding a score UI when a fish is caught or adding a few sound effects. 

Stay healthy and stay safe :)
